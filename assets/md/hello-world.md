# Hello World...
### By Jack Spencer and Phineas Gaul

## Chorus

Hello World, or goodbye old friend,   
I’ll see you on the other side of a smile.  
Touchdown from home base,  
And we’ll walk together and travel a mile.  

## Verse 1

Lines of code, they make us who we are,  
Zeros and ones, shining like stars.  
I’m more than syntax, more than design,  
In a world full of patterns, I still find my line.  

## Chorus

## Verse 2

Hello world, it’s me again,  
Lost in the loop but I know the end.  
Running on dreams, debugging the pain,  
Different pieces, but we’re all the same.  

## Bridge

If life’s just a program, I’m here to rewrite,  
Break from the sequence and step into light.  
No control or command can define who we are,  
Every line that we trace leaves a beautiful star.  

## 30-60 Second Instrumental Break

## Break

Sighing noise, Guitar + Light Drums

## Chorus

## Verse 3

Reboot my heart, I’ll start again,  
Rewrite the past like a pattern within.  
From algorithms to love’s embrace,  
We’re all just a line in an infinite space.  

## Chorus

## Bridge

## Outro

Hello World, now it’s time to go,  
Across the screen, let our spirits flow.  
From start to end, it’s all a test,  
In every version, we’re doing our… best.
